# RoadMapCode
My versions of a code, before looking into it on the internet - Algorithms from Roadmap Computer Science
In c# (for now)

1.Brute Force Algorithm - completes
In Comparison to the example given from the original site, there is a big difference between my code and the one given.
Not because it's in java, but because of the complexity behind it.
I will experiment more with my code until I am sure, that there aren't any errors
